    <p>To get started, you'll need to put some money in your Waya Wallet.</p>

        (or with internet banking) and that's it you can begin to explore the full Waya PayChat Package, enjoying the
        possibilities we have prepared for you.</p>
    <p>We're sure Waya PayChat is simple enough for you to DIY, but if you ever need our help, we're always one email
        <a href="#">(cusomerservice1@wayapaychat.com)</a> away.
